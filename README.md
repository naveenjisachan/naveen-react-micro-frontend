# naveen-react-micro-frontend
React Microfrontend (MFE) component that encapsulates a fully functional todo list application, we can understand complete flow with 5 points mentioned below.

# To understand the React microfrontend concept, we've created two separate applications named "host" and "remote".

# In the "remote" repository, we've implemented the complete todo list functionality and exported it.

# Within the "host" repository, we import and utilize the todo list functionality from the "remote" repository.

# To run the applications, navigate to the "remote" repository and execute npm start, then do the same in the "host" repository. Both applications will run on different ports with identical functionality.

# To run unit tests, navigate to the "remote" repository and execute npm test to view the test report.
